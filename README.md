# prolog.computer
A prototype Distributed [Web Prolog](https://github.com/Web-Prolog/swi-web-prolog) implementation.  This is a scratchpad project for now.  Nothing works.  Conversations are happening in [Projects](https://github.com/damons/prolog.computer/projects) and [Issues](https://github.com/damons/prolog.computer/issues) as project planning happens.  This project is in the planning stages, and we want everything done in the public.  This is why you are reading such a rough draft right now.  :)

For now, if you are seeking help on [Web Prolog](https://github.com/Web-Prolog/swi-web-prolog) or the Prolog programming language, I recommend visiting the [SWI-Prolog community discourse group](https://swi-prolog.discourse.group/), or just [SWI-Prolog](https://swi-prolog.org).
